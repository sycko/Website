As mentioned before, the vast majority of my projects are posted to <a href=https://soundcloud.com/officialsycko >Soundcloud.</a> There I produce under the alias sYcko, producing single tracks, and remixes.

In addition to my soundcloud projects, with the help of some friends, I also built the subwoofer I use to mix and master my music. Over the duration of a week, we constructed an 18" x 18" MDF board box for an Eminence Lab 12 Subwoofer. Following the construction of the box for the subwoofer, we built the desk I currently use. It is a 5' wide wooden desk with aluminium accents and selving on the legs.

You can also find two electronics projects on the Analog and Digital tabs of this website. One is a MIDI instrument, the other is a stylophone. You can find working videos, and write ups on each project there.
