I am a student with a strong passion for music.

Music and rhythm was an integral part of my life before I was born. My mother is the artistic director of a dance studio, so I like to think that I have had music around me since conception. 

Although I succeeded academically, I was always drawn towards music. My first choral experience started in elementary school, and I persisted with that through Middle and High School.

About halfway through my sophomore year of high school, I discovered Electronic Dance Music (EDM). I was enthralled by the diversity of sound, as well as the complexity, depth, and beauty that each style had to offer.

This fascination led to the purchase of a mixing deck, and the software by Native Instuments, called Traktor. I began to teach myself about different genres inside of EDM, then realized that I needed improved computing power, and a higher quality sound system. With the help of some friends, I built a new computer with a more advanced sound card. We then constucted an 18" by 18" MDF subwoofer box to place an Eminence LAB 12 subwoofer in. I also aquired a pair of studio grade monitors for enhanced listening and mixing. This new system allowed me to listen with more clarity to the subtle differences between genres.

Soon after, I began to experiment with combining different tracks to create mashup (mixing tracks with similar beats per minute into a compilation). I started by recreating certain mashups I had heard at shows, or on mixes that other DJs had posted. Doing this led me to produce original ideas. By using sampling, looping, and mastering, my best ideas were compiled into one Extended Play (EP).

After coming to grips with creating compilations of other people's work, I started working on original tracks. Using the same software I had used to create my mashups, Reaper by Cockos, I began to experiment with writing and producing my own work. To help me with this I purchased a MIDI Keyboard, this enables me to write melodies with chords, as well as record live keyboard playing.

Many of the mashups and original tracks can be found on my <a href=https://soundcloud.com/officialsycko ">Soundcloud.</a>
