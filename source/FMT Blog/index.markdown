Data Sonification
---

1) Title sequence
2) Flash “What is data sonification?” across screen
3) Open with asking people (sitting down) what they think data sonification is (15-30 sec) (Jeopardy music in background)
4) Cue upbeat background music and graphics
5) Go into short (extremely scientific) explanation (intro)
6) Show people’s confused reactions
7) Explain how data sonfication works (explain like I’m 5, with slower and easier music)
8) Again, a fair amount of graphics / background music
9) Explain what data display is
10) Show examples through grapics and facts
11) Explain what data sonification is used for
12) Show examples through graphics
13) Close with people’s reactions of hearing the information / explaining it in their own words
14) Conclusion with participants being enlightened
15) Outro music

Make graphics / sound affects as randomly funny as possible, formatted like a Buzzfeed video, but informative and easy to understand


Directional Response
---

For this experiment I worked with Jake, Emre, and Lauren and we used Studio E. We placed the Eon speaker near the front desk, due to the excess of chairs this was the best place we could place the speaker without entirely rearranging the studio. Sadly this positioning put the back of the speaker 5 feet from the nearest wall which could have messed with some of our readings due to sound reverberation off the wall. We then used the SPL meter to measure frequencies 3 feet and 1.5 feet from the speaker.

With few exceptions, as we rotated around the speaker, the SPL readings decreased until we hit 180 degrees, then the readings began to climb again. As you can see in the graphs below all of my frequencies are highest at the 0 degree point, and most of them are lowest at the 180 degree mark. There is some variation in the SPL readings due to the positioning of the speaker (being near to a wall), as well as the hum from the air conditioning units in the studio.

This experiment actually surprised me. I had expected that the higher frequencies would be significantly lower on the SPL meter if we weren’t standing directly in front of the speaker. This is because higher frequencies are more directional than low frequencies (well known as being almost omnidirectional). However, if you look at the polar charts below, you will see that the higher frequencies do not make a cardioid pattern like I had expected. Part of my thesis was based off of an ideal situation which cannot be created unless we were in an anechoic chamber. If that were the case, then the higher frequencies would have extremely high SPL readings when the meter was directly in front of the speaker and lower readings in any other position. Low frequencies in an anechoic chamber would have the same reading in any location due to the omnidirectional trait of low frequencies.

Distance vs. Intensity
---

In this experiment we were measuring the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) at different frequencies. As the SPL meter got farther from the speaker, the readings decreased, which was expected. In the studio there were a few different sounds that could have affected the readings, there was the hum of the air conditioner, as well as the sirens from an emergency response vehicle.

Our speaker was placed near the front left corner of Studio D. It was five feet from front wall, four feet from left wall, twelve feet from back wall, eighteen feet from entrance wall, resting on the floor, and five feet below the ceiling. It was also at a 180 degree angle with closest wall, facing the entrance to the studio.

We placed the SPL Meter at the same level as the speaker hoping to get the best reading possible.

My partners were Ally and Emma, Ally ran the Max patch while Emma positioned the SPL Meter, and I recorded the distance and dB reading.

We started at one and a half feet and recorded all of the frequencies, including our chosen frequency of 250 Hz, then progressed to three feet, six feet, and then twelve feet. Making sure to get an equal reading for all frequencies at the specified distance.

I had expected the dB readings to decrease as the SPL Meter got farther from the speaker due to the Inverse Square Law of Sound, and for the most part, that is what happened. The only frequency where there was little to no change was at 100 Hz, I can only assume that the reason for this was due to the room we were using. Sound will follow the Inverse Square Law perfectly if there are no reflections or reverberations. The reason the 100hz frequency went up at the end was due to the reflections and reverberations. Lower frequencies cause the air particles to slowly move and adjust whereas the higherfrequencies just push the airwaves quickly and abruptly causing them to be shot out in a more direct beam, as opposed to the omnidirectional 100hz frequency.

In conclusion, for the vast majority of the readings, the dBs dropped as the SPL Meter was moved farther away.

Listen Record Listen

This experiment was set up using 3 different areas and a HiFi recording device. I recorded myself in two different locations, as well as the ambiance at a local garden. In the two different rooms where I recorded myself, I began by saying my name and the room I was in. I then counted up to 10 and then said the ABCs. This was so I could tell the difference between the audio quality of different rooms. The first room I recorded myself in was Studio B on the 8th floor, following that I went out to the lobby of the 8th floor and recorded the same thing. I recorded my outside portion of the assignment at Jefferson Market Garden.

In <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sycko-1/studio-b/s-6JYkl/ >Studio B</a>, my voice sounded very crisp and clean. There was limited to no feeback or reverb in the studio. However when I recorded myself in the <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sycko-1/lobby/s-gzFDu/ >lobby</a> I had a different experience. My voice wasn't as crisp or loud, it was quieter and had more reverb. In addition there was more white noise in the lobby than in Studio B.

While doing the <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sycko-1/outdoors/s-wbcnJ/ >recording outside</a> I heard many different things. The most prominent was the vehicles. The majority of the sounds I heard either consisted of the roar of an engine, the squeaking breaks of taxis, and a car horn. The engine roar was from a deisel truck, which means that it's frequency was lower than most other vehicles, but it's amplitude was greater. The squeaky breaks had both a high amplitude and frequency. The car horns generally lay in the mid range when it comes to frequency, but have a high amplitude in order to be heard.

In addition to all these sounds, I also heard things that weren't as prominent, such as the clicking of heels as people walked by in their dress shoes, the rustling of the trees, and the crinkling of a plastic bag. However when I went back and listend to the recording on my computer I was no longer able to hear the intricate sounds that I heard while sitting in the garden.

None of these sounds were consistent throughout the recording, because everything was moving and changing. This is why sound changes over time. There are too many factors involved to keep sound consistent. The closest I came to a consistent sound was in Studio B, due to the fact that it is a Studio and designed to keep the quality of sound at an equal rate. This experiment confirms what we had read in the chapter this week about frequency perception, effects of reflections, and distance and depth perception.
