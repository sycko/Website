Listen Record Listen
---

This experiment was set up using 3 different areas and a HiFi recording device. I recorded myself in two different locations, as well as the ambiance at a local garden. In the two different rooms where I recorded myself, I began by saying my name and the room I was in. I then counted up to 10 and then said the ABCs. This was so I could tell the difference between the audio quality of different rooms. The first room I recorded myself in was Studio B on the 8th floor, following that I went out to the lobby of the 8th floor and recorded the same thing. I recorded my outside portion of the assignment at Jefferson Market Garden.

In <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sycko-1/studio-b/s-6JYkl/ >Studio B</a>, my voice sounded very crisp and clean. There was limited to no feeback or reverb in the studio. However when I recorded myself in the <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sycko-1/lobby/s-gzFDu/ >lobby</a> I had a different experience. My voice wasn't as crisp or loud, it was quieter and had more reverb. In addition there was more white noise in the lobby than in Studio B.

While doing the <a href=https://soundcloud.com/sycko-1/outdoors/s-wbcnJ/ >recording outside</a> I heard many different things. The most prominent was the vehicles. The majority of the sounds I heard either consisted of the roar of an engine, the squeaking breaks of taxis, and a car horn. The engine roar was from a deisel truck, which means that it's frequency was lower than most other vehicles, but it's amplitude was greater. The squeaky breaks had both a high amplitude and frequency. The car horns generally lay in the mid range when it comes to frequency, but have a high amplitude in order to be heard.

In addition to all these sounds, I also heard things that weren't as prominent, such as the clicking of heels as people walked by in their dress shoes, the rustling of the trees, and the crinkling of a plastic bag. However when I went back and listend to the recording on my computer I was no longer able to hear the intricate sounds that I heard while sitting in the garden.

None of these sounds were consistent throughout the recording, because everything was moving and changing. This is why sound changes over time. There are too many factors involved to keep sound consistent. The closest I came to a consistent sound was in Studio B, due to the fact that it is a Studio and designed to keep the quality of sound at an equal rate. This experiment confirms what we had read in the chapter this week about frequency perception, effects of reflections, and distance and depth perception.
