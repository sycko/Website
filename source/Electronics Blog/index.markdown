<a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/Arcade-Button-MIDI-Controller/?ALLSTEPS >These</a> are instructions for a MIDI controller built using an Arduino microcontroller.  This controller can send and receive MIDI messages to your PC, and allows you to control your software program such as Traktor. The white arcade buttons you see in the picture are the inputs and each button is mapped to a different sound/signal. When a button is pressed, it sends a signal to the software which is then sent to the listener.

<a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Dance-Room/?ALLSTEPS >This</a> is a guide to build an Audio Visualizer using an Arduino microcontroller.  This visualizer receives audio from the microphone jack of your computer, allowing it to accept itâ€™s own sound fed back, or sound from any other audio playing device. The change in sound causes the lights to pulse and change.

<a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/Music-Party-Facebook-Connected-Arduino-Powered-/ >This</a> is an automatically shuffling music player run by an Arduino microcontroller. A RFID reader reads the unique ID of whatever device/card was placed near it. The signal is then sent to the Arduino microcontroller, which sends a signal to the music server. Once that process is completed the preferred music of the device/card owner is added to playlist to be shuffled.

<a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/Electronic-Music-Box-Powered-by-Arduino-sort-of/ >This</a> is the design for a music box powered by an Arduino microcontroller. The music is stored on a piece of paper and read through the device. As the paper passes through the device an infrared light reads the black and white marking on the paper and sends a signal to be played by the music box.

<a href=http://www.instructables.com/id/This-Is-Your-Brain-On-Music/step3/Beat-detection-music-visualization-Arduino-and-Pro/ >This</a> is a design for a musical beat detector controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The designer uses processing to register the sound, which is then transmitted to the visualizer. By using processing, the designer doesn't have to worry about white noise. To get different colors, the designer assigned colors to different buckets. When a beat lands in a certain bucket, that color is displayed.
