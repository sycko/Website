  About
</h1>
<hr class="divider">


<p>I am a student with a strong passion for music.</p>

<p>Ever since I was a child, music has not been far from my reach. My mother owns a dance studio, and my father comes from a family of vocalists. Throughout grade school I studied choir. High school really peaked my interest in music and I took many electives involving music.</p>

<p>About halfway through my sophomore year of high school, I discovered Electronic Dance Music (EDM). This discovery was the focal point to many of the musical endeavors to follow.</p>

<p>Early into my junior year I acquired a mixing deck, and the software Traktor. I began to teach myself about different genres inside of EDM. Each genre had a certain style and differing beats per minute. This made my learning curve all the more challenging. Slowly, but surely I learned as much as I could about the process of mixing tracks together.</p>

<p>This newfound hobby led me to try new and different things. I began building my music library. This peaked my interest in mashups. I started by recreating certain mashups I had heard at shows, or on mixes that other DJs had posted. Once I had done that, I started to try original ideas. Eventually, my best ideas were compiled into one Extended Play (EP).</p>

<p>Soon after the release of my Mashup EP, I felt the need to have another, tougher goal. I wanted to make an original track. Using the same software I had used to create my mashups, Reaper, I began to work on my next goal. Over the span of about 2 weeks I worked hard on creating something that I liked and was proud of.</p>

<p>Eventually I had to stop tinkering with the track and decide that it should stay the way it is. I then released the song on my soundcloud and began working on the next track.</p>

<p>Now I am currently working on as many new ideas as possible, attempting to find a sound that I like and want to stick with. I look forward to all the work I have ahead of me, and all the fun things that go with it.</p>
